# Description

This application tracks temperature readings in real-time using a timer. Every second, the application generates a random temperature value and saves it to a SQL Server database along with the current timestamp. It also displays the temperature on a live line chart for visual representation. The user can start and stop the timer, as well as clear the data from the database.
